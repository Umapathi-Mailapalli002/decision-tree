# Decision Tree

## Overview
The Decision Tree application is a user-friendly tool designed to recommend personalized travel destinations based on user preferences. By answering a series of questions, users receive tailored travel suggestions along with visual references to make their decision-making process easier and more enjoyable.

## Features
- **Dynamic Recommendations**: Generates travel destination recommendations based on user inputs (e.g., preference, type, and budget).
- **Visual Appeal**: Displays engaging images corresponding to the recommended destinations.
- **Interactive Interface**: Features a responsive interface with CSS animations to enhance user engagement.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the application.
- **CSS**: Styling, including animations, to improve the visual appeal.
- **JavaScript**: Handles user inputs, dynamically generates recommendations, and updates the DOM.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Umapathi-Mailapalli002/decision-tree
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd DecisionTree
   ```
3. **Open `index.html` in Your Browser**:
   - Double-click on `index.html`.
   - Alternatively, use a live server extension in your code editor for a better development experience.

## How It Works
1. **User Interaction**: Users fill out a form, providing their travel preferences (e.g., activity, type of trip, and budget).
2. **Dynamic Recommendation**:
   - Based on the input, the application generates a unique key (e.g., `Beach-Adventure-Low`).
   - The key is matched against a predefined set of recommendations.
3. **Output Display**:
   - A recommendation text is displayed in the interface.
   - Corresponding images are dynamically added to provide a visual reference.

## Example Recommendation
### Input:
- Preference: Beach
- Type: Adventure
- Budget: Medium

### Output:
- **Text**: "We recommend a trip to Bali, Indonesia! Enjoy sandy beaches, water sports, and cultural exploration."
- **Images**:

   - Add more input combinations for diverse travel destinations.
2. **Travel API Integration**:
   - Fetch real-time destination details, reviews, and pricing.
3. **User Feedback Collection**:
